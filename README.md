## About The Project

Code Crumbs - We are a community for high school coders. Join us on the journey of exploring, learning and building cool things. This is the Code Crumb website repository built using Hugo, a simple, fast, and flexible static site generator.

#### Colour Palette
The website uses a basic color scheme derived off of the logo's hue. Light schemed by default, a dark mode is available consisting of the exchanged foreground and background colours. 

The scheme can be found at `static/css/custom.css`
