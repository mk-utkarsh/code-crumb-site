# Code Crumbs Code of Conduct

## Introduction

We are dedicated to providing a harassment-free and inclusive experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

We invite all those who participate in our community to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

## Expected Behavior

- Be respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
- Give and receive constructive feedback gracefully.
- Assume good intentions from others.
- Be mindful of your language and how it might be perceived by others.
- Remember that harassment and other exclusionary behavior are not acceptable in our community.

## Unacceptable Behavior

Harassment and other exclusionary behaviors include, but are not limited to:

- Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion.
- Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment.
- Deliberate misgendering or use of ‘dead’ or rejected names.
- Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behavior in spaces where they’re not appropriate.
- Threats of violence or incitement of violence towards any individual or group.
- Incitement of violence or promotion of hate groups.
- Microaggressions, including but not limited to: backhanded compliments, assumptions about disability, expressions of surprise at someone’s skill level, etc.
- Unwelcome sexual attention.
- Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others.

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, we may take any action deemed appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all Code Crumbs spaces and identification of the participant as a harasser to other Code Crumbs members or the general public.

## Reporting

If you are the subject of or witness to unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify us as soon as possible at codecrumbshs@gmail.com

Additionally, community organizers are available to help community members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe.

## Addressing Grievances

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify the Code Crumbs team with a concise description of your grievance. Your grievance will be handled in accordance with our existing governing policies.

## Scope

We expect all community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all Code Crumbs community spaces—online and in-person—as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to Code Crumbs affairs.

This code of conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of community activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.
